## Keto Tracker

### What is it?
This is an app to help track your macronutrients while on a diet. Users can enter the details of their meal and see the total nutritional value of all of their meals that day.

### Tech
Python/Django, React.js


### Progress
Currently this app only works in a development environment. Meals can be logged and the graph component will update to reflect any changes. The next big goal is to add either sessions support or user authentication, as currently there is no differentiation between users. After getting that working, I'll get the app hosted somewhere. Then I would like to work on a graph that shows caloric/macro intake over time so users can see how well they're adhering to their diet.
